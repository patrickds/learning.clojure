# Clojure Playgound

This repository is used to play around with clojure c:

I'm implementing a couple exercises (the interesting ones) from [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) and some core functions that makes think!

## Setup
You will need:

- [Java](https://java.com/en/download/)
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

I also recommend using the awesome [Ultra](https://github.com/venantius/ultra) plugin for better repl output.

### Then

```shell
lein deps         # install all dependencies
lein test         # run all tests
lein test-refresh # run all tests in watch mode
```
